title: Studio Display on a Windows PC

description: Doing something that you should probably not do...
---

I have a dual monitor desk setup — one Apple Studio Display and one ASUS 144hz
gaming monitor. For the past few months, I've just been turning my head to use
my Windows 11 desktop for flight sim. Unfortunately this is not ideal for a few
reasons:

- My second monitor is smaller
- My second monitor is 1080p
- My second monitor is offset to the right, so I have to turn my head.

So, I had a crazy idea. What if I could use my Apple Studio Display with my
Windows PC? Then I would be able to switch back and forth between my MacBook and
desktop seamlessly by switching out one cable to the Studio Display. Oh, if it
were only that easy. This article should serve as a guide to anyone wishing to
attempt the same thing.

**Fair warning**: _Your mileage may vary._ I was about ready to return the cable
to wherever it came from and admit defeat.

Prerequisites:

1. Belkin Charge and Sync Cable for HUAWEI VR Glass
2. Apple Studio Display
3. A strong will

### Ordering the cable

This is the easiest part of the whole process. Head to [eBay](https://ebay.com)
and search for a "Belkin Charge and Sync Cable for HUAWEI VR Glass". Find one
that is priced decently (under $130 as of the writing of this article). Order
it. Wait 3+ weeks for it to come via some carrier you've never heard of before.

### Plug it in and it works

Yeah, I thought so too... not so easy. Where to begin? When I plugged the
display in originally, it was "recognized" in Windows, but the display was
flashing black on and off repeatedly. Not a good sign. So, I started
troubleshooting. I knew you needed Boot Camp drivers to control the display, but
maybe those would have some effect on getting an output?

### Brigadier

Brigadier is a nifty tool for installing Boot Camp drivers on non-hackintosh
Windows computers. These drivers will allow you to control your display's
brightness from Windows. You can download it from
[here](https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier/releases/tag/0.2.6). Once you've
got it downloaded, open up a terminal and `cd` into the directory where the .exe
ended up. Follow these steps:

1. Run `brigadier.exe --m MacPro7,1` — this will download the Boot Camp
   installer and drivers from Apple
2. cd into `$WINPEDriver$` and delete all but the following:

- `Dolby`
- `AppleAudio`
- `AppleAudio_1883106B`
- `ApleSSD64`
- `AppleUSBVHCI`
- `SerialIO`

This will prevent Boot Camp from doing unnecessary work.

3. cd into `BootCamp\Drivers` — delete everything except the `Apple` and
   `Promise` directories

4. Here comes the fun part... cd in to `BootCamp\Drivers\Apple\BootCamp.msi`. If
   you can right click and run the msi as an administrator, go right ahead.
   Unfortunately in Windows 11, this wasn't so easy.

### Registry Hacking

Editing the registry in Windows is always a bit nerve racking. This one is quite
simple. I'll save myself the embarrassment of pretending to know exactly what
this edit does to Windows — it adds a "Run as Administrator" option when
right-clicking on .msi files. However, there is a deeper technical explanation.
I'm a Windows guy, but I don't know the specific inner workings of the registry.
If you're interested in that, here's GPT-4's attempt:

You'll need to add a registry entry called `runasuser` under
`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msi.Package\shell`. Right click on the `shell` folder, and
click "New > Key". Enter `runas` when prompted. Under the `shell\runas folder`,
double click in the right pane on "(Default)". Inside the value, type
`Run as &administrator`. Right click on the `runas` folder. Again, select "New >
Key". When prompted, enter `command` as the value. Double click on "(Default)"
on the right side under `command`. In the popup, type `msiexec /i "%1"`.

Below is a picture of how your directory structure should look when complete.

Once done, you can go back to the `BootCamp.msi` file and right click, and
select "Run as Administrator". Follow the installer's instructions, and then
reboot.

### Drivers and Firmware

Unfortunately this was not the end of the road for me. At this point, I was
concerned that my 1080Ti was incapable of driving the Studio Display due to
DisplayPort compatibility issues. I was half right — my graphics card needed a
firmware update. After searching around, I found
(this)[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/nv-uefi-update-x64/] firmware from
Nvidia. I installed this, and restarted my computer. Still a flashing black
screen...

### Nvidia Control Panel

After some thought, I realized that maybe I could tweak some settings in Nvidia
Control Panel. This was the key:

1. Enabling the Studio Display
2. Lowering the resolution to 3840x2160

For some odd reason, I had to click a tick box to enable output to the Studio
Display. I've never seen this before in Windows or Nvidia Control Panel in 10
years of owning Windows computers, but who knows. You may encounter the same
thing.

Next, I lowered the resolution for the display to 1920x1080. Voila! It worked! I
was shocked. Next, I started stepping the resolution up one by one, seeing if I
could get the display to exhibit the behavior it had before. It worked great,
until I made it up to 5K, and ultimately had to settle for 4K. My hunch is that
either the Belkin cable OR my 1080Ti just don't have the bandwidth, but I'm not
100% sure. We'll find out when I eventually upgrade to the 40 series.

### Recap

I'm glad I got the display working in Windows — I've hated not having the same
setup for my PC as I do for my MacBook. It actually works quite well — the
speakers work, the camera and microphone work, the USB ports work. The only
thing I am missing is the 5K resolution, but I'm not too upset. It was somewhat
a pain in the ass, but totally worth it. That said, I definitely had some help.

Just another disclaimer: your mileage may vary... even in guides that I read
using the exact same cable and display as me had different outcomes. I hope this
guide provides some hope for others trying to do the same. Good luck.
