description: Some plans for the blog and how it all works.
---

Welcome to my new blog. I started working on this for fun to see what it's
like to build a blog on top of Next.JS. Turns out, it's pretty easy and
the end result can be really cool. I'll dive in to the inner workings with
the goal of hopefully helping someone else on the same journey.

### How it works

All blog posts are written in MDX. MDX allows you to use JSX in markdown,
enabling much more complex content to be included in markdown. This portion
of my site is powered by a few packages:

- Most notably, the [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) package by [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev). It deals with parsing my mdx into
  beautiful type-safe objects that I can reference to build up the pages you are visiting
- [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) to enable Github's extended markdown syntax when writing posts
- [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code) for syntax highlighting in code blocks
- [reading-time](https://github.com/ngryman/reading-time) to calculate average reading times for my posts
- [unist-util-visit](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist-util-visit-children) to perform some AST transformations for code blocks

<br />
### Setting up contentlayer

Setting up contentlayer is not too difficult. I followed their tutorial [here](),
and I'd recommend you do the same. Alternatively, you can just install the necessary packages and "borrow" my config
[here](https://gist.github.com/cnrstvns/47cdd79ae9117a3724d98c826e00d21a).

I created a single post schema given that I only have one type of post. I've also
required that each post have a title, date, and description. These will be used to build
the "Post List" page, as well as used when rendering the header for each individual post.

I've also created a few computed fields — these are keys that will be available on every
generated `Post` object from contentlayer.

```ts title="contentlayer.config.ts"
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: 'Post',
  filePathPattern: `**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: 'mdx',
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The title of the post',
      required: true,
    },
    date: {
      type: 'date',
      description: 'The date of the post',
      required: true,
    },
    description: {
      type: 'string',
      description: 'The description of the post',
      required: true,
    },
  },
  computedFields: {
    url: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (post) => `/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`,
    },
    path: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (post) => post._raw.flattenedPath,
    },
    createdAt: {
      type: 'number',
      resolve: (post) => new Date(post.date).getTime(),
    },
    readingTime: {
      type: 'string',
      resolve: (post) => readingTime(post.body.raw).text,
    },
  },
}));

export default makeSource({
  contentDirPath: 'src/posts',
  documentTypes: [Post],
});
```

<br />
### Enabling syntax highlighting

Getting syntax highlighting working reliably took the longest when setting this blog up.
You'll need to add some additional configuration to your `contentlayer.config.ts`. Inside of your call
to `makeSource`, include the following code:

```ts title="contentlayer.config.ts"
export default makeSource({
  // ... the rest of the configuration we already set up
  mdx: {
    // Include GitHub markdown plugin
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],

    rehypePlugins: [
      // Include rehype syntax highlighting plugin
      [
        rehypePrettyCode,
        {
          // Pass our theme in, or use a default from shiki
          theme,

          // AST handling for highlighting and copying of empty lines
          onVisitLine(node: any) {
            if (node.children.length === 0) {
              node.children = [{ type: 'text', value: ' ' }];
            }
          },
          onVisitHighlightedLine(node: any) {
            node.properties.className.push('line--highlighted');
          },
          onVisitHighlightedWord(node: any) {
            node.properties.className = ['word--highlighted'];
          },
        },
      ],

      // AST transformation to pass raw value to each code block
      () => (tree) => {
        visit(tree, (node) => {
          if (node?.type === 'element' && node?.tagName === 'div') {
            if (!('data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment' in node.properties)) {
              return;
            }

            for (const child of node.children) {
              if (child.tagName === 'pre') {
                child.properties.raw = node.raw;
              }
            }
          }
        });
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

<br />
### Styling the code blocks

Now that syntax highlighting is working properly, we need to make our code blocks look a little better.
We can easily handle this in our global css file, by adding the following properties. Please note that I'm using TailwindCSS,
so these properties may differ if you are not using Tailwind.

```css title="globals.css"
/* Empty line styling */
div[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] code {
  display: grid;
}

/* Apply styling to code block */
div[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] {
  overflow: hidden;
  @apply bg-neutral-800 rounded-sm leading-6 py-0;
}

/* Apply styling to code block body */
div[data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment] pre {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  @apply bg-neutral-800 px-5 py-0 text-sm leading-7;
}

/* Apply styling to code block title */
div[data-rehype-pretty-code-title] {
  @apply bg-neutral-700 px-4 py-2 text-sm text-neutral-300 font-medium;
}
```

Once you've applied styling to your code blocks, they'll be looking a lot nicer. Let's move on to creating the other primitives we'll need.

<br />
### Extending contentlayer

Contentlayer allows you to create React components, use them in Markdown and then will render everything as if
it were written in a React page.

For this blog, we'll be keeping things pretty basic. I'll start with the following components, and add more as I see fit.

- Figure, for posting images with captions in a consistent manner.
- Override the `a` tag to use `next/link` for internal links.
- Expose `Image` from `next/image` for optimized image loading

```tsx title="components.tsx"
const linkClassName = 'text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500 transition';

export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  /* Override the `a` tag so when a link is internal,
   * use the Next.js link component
   */
  a: ({ href, children }) => {
    if (!href?.startsWith('/')) {
      return (
        <a
          className={linkClassName}
          href={href as string}
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          {children}
        </a>
      );
    }

    return (
      <Link className={linkClassName} href={href as string}>
        {children}
      </Link>
    );
  },
  /* Custom figure component for images */
  Figure: ({
    src,
    width,
    height,
    caption,
    className,
  }: {
    src: string;
    width: number;
    height: number;
    caption: string;
    className?: string;
  }) => {
    return (
      <figure className="flex flex-col w-full items-center">
        <Image
          src={src}
          width={width}
          height={height}
          alt={caption}
          className={clsx('rounded-sm', className)}
        />
        <figcaption className="mt-1.5 text-sm text-neutral-400">
          {caption}
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    );
  },
};
```

Great, we've enabled syntax highlighting, styled our code blocks, and created the necessary custom components. We're ready to write some content.

<br />
### Writing our first post

Now that we have all the pieces ready, we can write a short demo to show off what we've been working on.

```mdx title="src/posts/hello-world.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
date: 2023-05-01:00:00:00
description: Some plans for the blog and how it all works.
---

Hello world. This is a demo post for my first blog post. Here's some text: wow! text... goes, here?

<Figure
  src="/images/me.webp"
  width={200}
  height={200}
  caption="The owner of this house"
/>
```

If all is configured properly, you should be able to visit your post page and view the content you just wrote.
If not, you're SOL. Just kidding — try asking ChatGPT. Or, if you're old school, give the old google-fu a go.
