title: Introducing zod-fs

description: My first open-source Typescript library
---

Earlier this year, I was developing a desktop application. It required that I
store user data in JSON files on the user's machine to store application state.
The first attempt I made at this years ago used
[jsonfile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonfile) which is just a wrapper
around `fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile`, wrapped in `JSON.parse` and
`JSON.stringify` respectively. Now that I work primarily in Typescript, this
wasn't going to work for me.

If you want to skip ahead and just read the docs, head
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-fs).

### The old way

```js
const PROXIES = `${DATA_PATH}proxies.json`;
const checkPath = Helpers.data(PROXIES, '{"Default": []}');

module.exports.getProxies = async function getProxies() {
  await checkPath();
  return jsonfile.readFile(PROXIES);
};
```

As you can see for CRUD operations, I would check that the path exists, and then
return the result of a call to jsonfile. This was exhausting to maintain. Let's
discuss some of the issues this method had.

### Issues

- Lack of type-safety: Because I wrote this in JavaScript and everything is a
  proxied call to `JSON.parse` or `JSON.stringify`, the best we can get in terms
  of type-safety would be type-casting.
- Lack of support for additional operating systems: I only considered support
  for macOS and Windows at the time.
- Lack of support for true CRUD capability: Because `jsonfile` only supports
  read and write, we need to write our own update and reset methods for each
  model.
- Lack of maintainability: Each CRUD function needs to call a function to ensure
  that the file exists when being read or written to.

### Solutions:

- We will use [zod](https://npmjs.org/package/zod) to create type-safe schemas
  for our data models.
- We will explicitly support multiple operating systems and allow for additional
  ones with as little overhead as possible.
- We will create generic helper functions to create the necessary helpers to
  create CRUD functions for each data model.
- We will build in automatic parsing, validation, and default data replacement
  to our helper functions

### What operations do we need?

- Read: Retrieve data from a file
- Write: Write new data to a file
- Update: Write and merge new data into existing data into a file

Remember that all these operations should be type-safe, guarantee that they
return data that matches our schema, and guarantee that the file exists with our
default data.

In order to achieve this, we need to write a series of helper functions to
simplify our interactions with each file.

### Writing our helper functions:

#### getAppPath

We need to return the path to the consumer's app data folder given the name of
our application. We include safe known paths for macOS and Windows, and default
to the HOME directory provided by Node.js otherwise. This solves our previous
problem of not supporting numerous operating systems.

```ts
const getAppPath = (appId: string) => {
  const appName =
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? appId : `${appId} (development)`;

  if (process.platform === 'win32') {
    return `${process.env.APPDATA}/${appName}/`;
  }

  if (process.platform === 'darwin') {
    return `${process.env.HOME}/Library/Application Support/${appName}/`;
  }

  return `${process.env.HOME}/${appName}/`;
};
```

#### getFilePath

We need to return the path to a file given the name of our application and the
name of the file.

```ts
const getFilePath = (appName: string, fileName: string) => {
  return `${getAppPath(appName)}${fileName}`;
};
```

#### ensurePath

We need to make sure that the path to the file we want to read or write to
exists.

```ts
const ensurePath = async (appName: string, filePath: string) => {
  const exists = await fs.pathExists(filePath);
  if (exists) return;

  await fs.ensureDir(getAppPath(appName));
};
```

#### ensureFile

We need to make sure that a file exists given the name of our application, the
path to a file, the default data that belongs in that file, and optionally
settings for `JSON.stringify`.

```ts
const ensureFile = async (
  appName: string,
  filePath: string,
  fileData: unknown,
  jsonOptions?: JSONOptions,
) => {
  await ensurePath(appName, filePath);

  await fs.writeFile(
    filePath,
    JSON.stringify(
      fileData,
      jsonOptions?.replacer ?? null,
      jsonOptions?.space ?? 2,
    ),
  );
};
```

#### writeFile

We need to write data to a file given the path to the file, data to write to
that file, and optionally settings for `JSON.stringify`.

```ts
const writeFile = async (
  filePath: string,
  fileData: unknown,
  jsonOptions?: JSONOptions,
) => {
  await fs.writeFile(
    filePath,
    JSON.stringify(
      fileData,
      jsonOptions?.replacer ?? null,
      jsonOptions?.space ?? 2,
    ),
  );
};
```

#### readFile

This method is where things start to get interesting. `readFile` is a generic
method that accepts a Zod schema as one of its parameters. Given this parameter,
we can require that the consumer pass a default object that matches the shape of
the Zod schema using the `z.infer` generic type.

This method first uses `fs-extra` to read data from the file. Inside of a
try-catch block, we use `JSON.parse` to turn the text we just read using
`fs-extra` into an object that Javascript can understand. We then use the Zod
schema's `parse` method to make sure that the data conforms to that model's
schema. If not, it will throw an error. If an error is thrown, we make a call to
our `restoreDefaults` method. In the success case, the data from the file is
returned. Otherwise, the default data that was provided is returned and written
to the file.

```ts
const readFile = async <T extends ZodType<any, any>>(
  filePath: string,
  schema: T,
  defaultData: z.infer<T>,
) => {
  const fileData = await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, { encoding: 'utf-8' });

  try {
    const jsonData = JSON.parse(fileData);

    schema.parse(jsonData);

    return jsonData as z.infer<T>;
  } catch (err) {
    await restoreDefaults<T>(filePath, defaultData);

    return defaultData;
  }
};
```

#### restoreDefaults

This method uses `fs-extra` and `JSON.stringify` to write the default JSON data
to a file in the case that there was an error parsing or the file does not yet
exist.

```ts
const restoreDefaults = async function restoreDefaults<T>(
  filePath: string,
  data: T,
) {
  await fs.writeFile(filePath, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));

  return data;
};
```

Now that we've written all of our helper methods, it's time to combine them into
a cohesive API that solves the problems we set out to alleviate.

### The FileHelper class:

Let's define the shape of our core library helper, then we'll write
implementations for each method.

```ts
class FileHelper<T extends ZodType<any, any>> {
  appName: string;
  fileName: string;
  schema: T;
  defaultValues: z.infer<T>;
  json?: JSONOptions;

  constructor(
    appName: string,
    fileName: string,
    schema: T,
    defaultValues: z.infer<T>,
    json?: JSONOptions,
  ) {
    this.appName = appName;
    this.fileName = fileName;
    this.schema = schema;
    this.defaultValues = defaultValues;

    if (this.json) this.json = json;
  }

  async read(): Promise<z.infer<T>>;

  async write(data: z.infer<T>): Promise<void>;

  async update(data: Partial<z.infer<T>>): Promise<void>;
}
```

When creating an instance of our library, we accept a few options. The name of
our app as a string, the name of the file as as string, the Zod schema that
applies to the file, the default values for that file, and optionally settings
for `JSON.stringify`.

We return three methods in an instance of our library: read, write, and update.
Read returns a promise that resolves with the data from the file. Write returns
a promise that resolves with a void value. The same is true for update.

Let's implement each method.

#### read

First, we get the path to the file using our `getFilePath` method written
earlier. Then, we ensure that this file exists and write our default data to it
if not. Finally, we return the value of that file guaranteeing that it conforms
to the schema for that file.

```ts
async read() {
  const filePath = getFilePath(this.appName, this.fileName);

  await ensureFile(this.appName, filePath, this.defaultValues, this.json);

  return readFile(filePath, this.schema, this.defaultValues);
}
```

### write

First, we use the `parse` method on the Zod schema to ensure that the data
passed is valid for that schema. Next, we compute the path to the file given the
name of the application and the name of the file. Then, we ensure that this file
exists and write our default data to it if not. Finally, we write the data to
the file.

```ts
async write(data: z.infer<T>) {
  this.schema.parse(data);

  const filePath = getFilePath(this.appName, this.fileName);

  await ensureFile(this.appName, filePath, this.defaultValues, this.json);

  await writeFile(filePath, data, this.json);
}
```

### update

Update requires a few extra steps because we only require the consumer pass a
partial update to a file. We then deeply merge these changes into the existing
object.

First, we compute the path to the file given the name of the application and the
name of the file. Then, we ensure that this file exists and write our default
data to it if not. Next, we read the data from that file. We then deeply merge
the new values into the existing values. After we create the new object to be
stored, we call the Zod schema's `parse` method to ensure that the data still
matches the schema's shape. Finally, we write this data to the file.

```ts
async update(data: Partial<z.infer<T>>) {
  const filePath = getFilePath(this.appName, this.fileName);

  await ensureFile(this.appName, filePath, this.defaultValues, this.json);

  const fileData = await readFile(filePath, this.schema, this.defaultValues);

  const updatedData = deepMerge(fileData, data);

  this.schema.parse(updatedData);

  await writeFile(filePath, updatedData, this.json);
  }
```

Now that we've implemented all the methods in our helper class, we can write the
core method to create a zod-fs helper. The only argument this method will accept
is the name of our application as a string.

```ts
export type JSONOptions = {
  replacer?: (string | number)[] | null | undefined;
  space?: string | number | undefined;
};

export type CreateFileHelperOptions<T extends ZodType<any, any>> = {
  fileName: string;
  schema: T;
  defaultValues: z.infer<T>;
  json?: JSONOptions;
};

export const createZodFs = (appName: string) => {
  return {
    createFileHelper: <T extends ZodType<any, any>>({
      fileName,
      schema,
      defaultValues,
      json,
    }: CreateFileHelperOptions<T>) => {
      return new FileHelper(appName, fileName, schema, defaultValues, json);
    },
  };
};
```

And voila, we've implemented everything we need to use our new library. I hope
